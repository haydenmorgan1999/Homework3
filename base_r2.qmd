## Task 1
### Question A
```{r}
?read_csv()
```

**In 1-2 sentences, explain why we can not use specifically the read_csv() to read in these data.**
This homework assignment asks us to read in two files: data.txt and data2.txt. We are unable to use read_csv() to read in these data because their files do not contain comma separated values--they use semicolons instead. 

```{r}
data <- read_csv2("Data/data.txt", 
                  col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))

data
```
